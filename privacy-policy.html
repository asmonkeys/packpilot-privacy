    <h3>2.3 Analytics and Crash Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymized analytics and crash data through Apple's built-in analytics framework to improve app performance and stability. This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide the App's Core Functionality:</strong> Your trip and packing list data is used to deliver the core features of PackPilot</li>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    
    <h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>

        All of your personal packing data (trips, lists, items) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Apple's encrypted Core Data framework. This data:
    </p>

        <li>Never leaves your device</li>
        <li>Is not backed up to our servers</li>
        <li>Is protected by your device's security features (passcode, biometric authentication)</li>
        <li>May be included in your iCloud backup if you have iCloud Backup enabled (this is managed by Apple, not us)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Security Measures</h3>

        <li>Following Apple's security best practices</li>
        <li>Regularly updating the app to address security vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

    <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>

    <h3>6.1 App Tracking Transparency (iOS 14+)</h3>

        All your data is stored on your device and is accessible to you within the app at all times. Currently, PackPilot does not offer a data export feature, but all information is visible within the app interface.
